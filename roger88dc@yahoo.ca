Good evening, on cTiVo i mamaged to pull a bunch of recording off my t6 successfully months ago. tried recently & in "top table" listing recordings on tivo i see a yellow circle with "!" in it and when I hover it says "Expired Recording" Is there any way to refresh this table and transfer via cTiVo? or do I have to delete the app & start again? 
Also is it possible that a new MAK # was generated by my tivo with a software upgrade? I saw that but a newer recording successfully transferred. Is it possible to change MAK # in cTiVo if has been changed by the t6 reveciver?  Thanks
